# Algonquin College Robotics

This is my personal master repository for some of the courses I took at Algonquin College's Robotics program.

## Why is this public?

Unfortunately over years I've lost track of a lot of project files, which is why I've decided upload any remaining content in hopes that I won't lose more.

At the time I took the program, I wasn't using Git or any revision control. In hindsight, it would have been extremely useful to have so I would be able to reference my previous work.
